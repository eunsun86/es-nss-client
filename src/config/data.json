      "lead_paragraph":"LAZAROF--Henri. Prolific composer and educator, Henri Lazarof, passed away from Alzheimer's disease at his home in Los Angeles, California. Mr. Lazarof was born in Sofia, Bulgaria on April 12, 1932, where he spent his youth studying at the Jesuit Lycee Francais. As a student, he showed an early talent in music, and became a concert pianist before his teenage years. In his early teens, he turned to music composition. His family immigrated to Tel Aviv, Israel where he studied with Paul Ben-Haim, a prominent Israeli composer. During Mr. Lazarof's army service, he organized concerts throughout Israel for the Israeli troops. He won the first musical scholarship awarded in Israel to attend the prestigious Saint Cecilia Academy in Rome, where he studied with the renowned composer Goffredo Petrassi. Mr. Lazarof arrived in Rome speaking four languages fluently but not one word of Italian. In three months, he mastered the Italian language and became a tour guide. He finished his four-year courses in three years, and won another scholarship to Brandeis University in Massachusetts. There he studied under the guidance of American composers Arthur Berger and Harold Shapero, and became fluent in English, his eighth language. In 1966, Mr. Lazarof moved to California and became a Professor Emeritus at the University of California, Los Angeles, teaching music composition and organizing contemporary music festivals. From 1970 to 1971, he served as composer-in-residence in Berlin; in 1979 he held the same position at the highly acclaimed Tanglewood Music Center in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1982 Mr. Lazarof decided to solely focus his attention on musical composition. Throughout the course of his career, Mr. Lazarof had 126 works published with the Associated Music Publishers, Theodore Presser, Bot and Bock, and others. These works include seven symphonies, three concertos for orchestra, three violin concertos, three cello concertos, two flute concertos, a viola concerto, a piano concerto, 11 string quartets, and innumerable pieces for orchestra, chamber orchestra, small ensembles, solo instruments, and mixed chorus. Numerous works were commissioned and recorded, and premiered by various orchestras throughout Europe, Asia, and the United States, including Carnegie Hall in New York; \"First Symphony\" with the Utah Symphony Orchestra; \"Concerto No. 2 Icarus\" with the Houston Symphony Orchestra; \"Concerto for Oboe and Chamber Orchestra\" with the New York Chamber Symphony; \"Symphony No. 5 for Solo Baritone, Mixed Chorus and Orchestra\" with the Seattle Symphony Orchestra. Mr. Lazarof's passion for art was reflected in his music, such as the \"String Quartet No. 8,\" homage to Paul Klee, and \"Tableaux (after Kandinsky)\" premiered by Garrick Ohlson and the Seattle Symphony Orchestra. His prizes included first place in the International Tchaikovsky Competition; First International Competition from Monaco for Concerto for Viola and Orchestra; and First International Prize City of Milan La Scala Award for his musical composition, \"Structures Sonores.\" He also received grants from the Ford Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts, as well as two Grammy nominations in 1991 for Best Contemporary Composition and Best Classical Performance Instrumental Soloist(s) with Orchestra. Mr. Lazarof's compositions were known for their broad range of textures, dynamics, and diversity of rhythms. Many of his works used unusual, seldom written combinations of instruments. By refusing to settle within any one ideology or style even those of his own previous works Mr. Lazarof remained faithful to his principal of growth and exploration, producing a body of work that will endure. Survivors include his wife, sister, son, daughter-in-law, four stepdaughters and their spouses, and nine grandchildren. Services will be on Friday, January 3, 2014, at Hillside Mortuary in Los Angeles, California, at 2:00pm. In lieu of flowers, the family would appreciate contributions to the Henri Lazarof Memorial Fund, c/o American Youth Symphony, 3424 Wilshire Boulevard, Suite 830, Los Angeles, California 90010, (310) 470-2332.",

      "lead_paragraph":"TETENBAUM--Herbert, whose boyhood bout with oseomyelitis, a bone-marrow infection that sent him to the hospital for multiple surgeries as a child and engendered within him a lifelong reverence for the practice of medicine, died December 29, 2013 in Palm Desert, CA, after a short illness at the age of 92. A retired obstetrician-gynecologist long active in medical education, Dr. Tetenbaum had moved to the desert community from Long Beach, NY, six months earlier with Sylvia Tetenbaum (nee Balopole), his wife of 69 years, who survives him. He is also survived by his children, Barbara Shepard of Las Vegas, NV, wife of Curtis Shepard; Abraham Tetenbaum of Los Angeles, CA, husband of Elizabeth R. Shafer; and Zelda Yoder, Reading, PA, wife of Mark Yoder. Additionally, he is survived by seven grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Three sisters survive him: Esther Heller, Mildred Berwitz, and Gloria Gimbel. He was predeceased by a brother, T. Leonard Tetenbaum and a sister, Beverly Schneider. Herbert Tetenbaum was born on March 25, 1921, at Beth-El Hospital in Brooklyn, NY, which later became Brookdale Hospital Medical Center during the 41 years he served on its medical staff. He graduated from Chicago Medical School (CMS), which later grew to become Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science during his tenure on its Board of Trustees. Dr. Tetenbaum grew up in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, the third of six children of Eastern European immigrants, Isaac and Anna Tetenbaum. He worked at his father's dry goods store and attended Samuel J. Tilden High School where he led the swing band to a city championship. As \"Ted Herberts,\" he played clarinet and saxophone at school dances and entertained at Catskill Mountains resorts during the summer. Dr. Tetenbaum attended the University of Texas at Austin where he majored in bacteriology, and drove the 1,750 miles back to Brooklyn every chance he got. He believed that attending school so far from home might give him an edge in applying to medical school as there were quotas in place restricting admissions for Jewish candidates from New York, but his admission was not immediate. Even the Army turned him down during World War II because of physical limitations resulting from his childhood operations. He worked in a defense plant before landing a job at the Rockefeller Institute in Manhattan as laboratory assistant to Dr. Karl Landsteiner, who in 1930 had won the Nobel Prize for discovering the blood groups. When Dr. Tetenbaum opened the letter that contained the news that he finally had been accepted to medical school, he was riding in a subway car with his girlfriend Sylvia, who exclaimed, \"Now we can get married!\" They sealed the bargain with a kiss and received a round of applause from their fellow passengers. Herb and Sylvia proved to be a formidable team in Chicago, together raising funds for the school, which attained its national accreditation the year he graduated. When they returned to Brooklyn and purchased their first home, which included an office for his general practice, the last thing in the world he expected was to be drafted. But the United States Army, now in need of physicians, had changed its mind and sent the growing Tetenbaum family to Fort Brooke in San Juan, Puerto Rico. There, by his own account, Dr. Tetenbaum attained the rank of Major, \"fought the battle of the Officers Club\" and acquired his medical specialty training. Back in Brooklyn, Dr. Tetenbaum became a Fellow of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American College of Surgeons, delivered thousands upon thousands of babies and remained deeply involved in the institutional lives of his school, hospital and various medical groups. For his tireless efforts on their behalf, he was showered with recognition in the form of dinners, tributes, awards, plaques, citations and statuettes. He especially prized his 1985 Distinguished Alumnus Award from Chicago Medical School where for several years he administered the Hippocratic oath to its graduating class. Dr. Tetenbaum earned the esteem and affection of all who knew him through loyalty, generosity, dedication, a Borscht Belt sense of humor and, when asked for it, sound advice. He lived to see his children's lives reflect his values. Barbara became a psychotherapist, Abraham a Broadway playwright and nonprofit executive, and Zelda an educator. His grandchildren and great-grandchildren gave him immense pleasure, and three family \"convocations\" on cruise ships were among the highlights of his later years. Dr. Tetenbaum was an avid music lover, theatergoer, horseback rider, reader, world traveler, extemporaneous speaker, mixologist and sports fan. He rooted for the home team, and when there was no home team, he rooted for the underdog. Having fulfilled his own dream, he encouraged and supported the aspirations of his family and friends. For someone who was not expected to make it out of childhood, he ended up touching and enriching countless lives.",
